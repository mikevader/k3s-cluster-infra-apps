  # This startupapicheck is a Helm post-install hook that waits for the webhook
  # endpoints to become available.
  # The check is implemented using a Kubernetes Job- if you are injecting mesh
  # sidecar proxies into cert-manager pods, you probably want to ensure that they
  # are not injected into this Job's pod. Otherwise the installation may time out
  # due to the Job never being completed because the sidecar proxy does not exit.
  # See https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/pull/4414 for context.
