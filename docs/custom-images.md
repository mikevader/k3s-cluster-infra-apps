k8s best practices for images: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices-how-and-why-to-build-small-container-images

For the task of creating my own images I got inspired by the setup from
[k8s-at-home][kah] and of it's contributers like [onedr0p]


## Testing

Use [GOSS](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss).

Use `dgoss` locally which is just a docker wrapper for goss.
